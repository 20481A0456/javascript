A Dynamic and Responsive Webpage

A Dynamic webpage was created by using Javascript. DOM methods are used to manipulate Html elements and css properties.
Two Switches are provided in the webpage. When the user clicks on off-switch the light goes away and only the cat's eyes are visible.
If the user clicks on on-switch the light glows and the cat appers. Also the backgroundcolor of the switches change when user clicks the switches.
The Statement "Switched On" changes to Switched Off when OFF button is clicked.
